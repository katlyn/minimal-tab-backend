      <h1>Minimal Tab</h1>
      <h3>Only what you need.</h3>
      <p>The bare minimum new tab - well, almost. Bare minimum would be nothing, and nothing looks bad. So I put a picture there instead. No text, no links, just a picture.</p>
      <p>In all reality, I just got tired of looking at a search bar I would never use. Why get another clock when I have one in my taskbar? I didn't buy it. Instead, I decided to go with something else. Something that didn't ask me to use it. Something that looked nice while still staying out of the way. And here we are.</p>
      <p>With images sourced from a curated collection at Unsplash, and animations sourced from the community, it has a clean and simple look. When we say no text, we mean it. There's nothing on the page but your image.</p>
      <p>But I get it, you want to make it your own. Well that's easy, just <strong>right click</strong>. Up pops a menu with options to get a new image, lock the current image in place, or change the animation mode.</p>
      <p>I hope you like using this as much as I enjoyed creating it. Minimal Tab is available for Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimal-tab/demlbafhccdnkoindnhnnagdabljhgeh">here</a>, and the source can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/theGordHoard/minimal-tab">on GitHub</a>.</p>
